# 👋 Hi, I’m Kentin Guillemot

Master’s student (M2) in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at ESILV, building real world  AI systems from classic ML to deep learning and LLM apps. 

Currently : looking for a final year internship and taking on select freelance AI/fullstack missions.

Interests : hands on AI development, designing and coding ML/DL models, building LLM/SLM based applications (RAG, chatbots, agentic systems), developing web tools with integrated AI components.

Location : Paris / Monaco

Open to hybrid/remote

## 📚 Recent Projects
1) Assistant Chatbot RAG (HR & Social Rights)

LLM assistant answering complex HR questions with RAG over PDFs/images.
Retrieval: FAISS/Chroma; OCR: EasyOCR; Orchestration: LangChain
Stack: Python, Django, OpenAI API, Docker
Results: faster answers, fewer inbound emails, robust multi-doc understanding.

2) ADK Multi-Agent System for Education

Developed during the Google GCPU Hackathon at ESILV.
Intelligent multi-agent system designed for adaptive learning: agents collaborate to generate multilingual lessons, quizzes and cours.
Uses the ADK (Agentic Development Kit) to structure autonomous behaviors and task delegation between AI agents.
Stack: Python, ADK, LLM APIs (Gemini), FastAPI
Impact: Demonstrated the potential of multi-agent LLMs for personalized education and autonomous content generation.

3) Fraud Detection System

End-to-end ML pipeline for transaction fraud.
Imbalance handling with SMOTE; models: LogReg, SVM, KNN
Focus on explainability and deployability (clean features, evaluation, baselines).

4) Simulateur de paie monégasque

Web-based payroll simulator developed for Hope SARL (Monaco).
Automates payroll calculation under Monaco’s legal and fiscal framework.
Integrates Django back-end logic for salary, contributions, and seniority bonuses, with dynamic UI.
Connected to a database of legal parameters and formula-driven computation logic for accurate simulation.
Stack: Python, Django, PostgreSQL, JavaScript
Outcome: Simplified HR management and reduced administrative time for clients.
