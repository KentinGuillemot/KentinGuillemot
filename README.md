# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Kentin Guillemot

Master‚Äôs student (M2) in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at ESILV, building real world  AI systems from classic ML to deep learning and LLM apps. 

Currently: looking for a final year internship and taking on select freelance AI/fullstack missions.

Interests: hands on AI development, designing and coding ML/DL models, building LLM/SLM based applications (RAG, chatbots, agentic systems), developing web tools with integrated AI components.

Location: Paris / Monaco

Open to hybrid/remote
