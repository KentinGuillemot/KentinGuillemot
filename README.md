# 👋 Hi, I’m Kentin Guillemot

Master’s student (M2) in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence at ESILV, building real-world AI systems—from classic ML to deep learning and LLM apps. I also ship full-stack web tools where AI isn’t just a demo: it powers features people actually use.
Currently: looking for a final-year internship and taking on select freelance AI/full-stack missions.
Interests: applied ML, RAG & agents, optimization, MLOps, and human-centric product design.

Location: Paris / Monaco · Open to hybrid/remote.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Languages : Python, JavaScript, C#, SQL, HTML/CSS
Data & ML : NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn (all models), XGBoost, LightGBM, Optuna
Deep Learning : PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras, Transformers
LLM & NLP : LangChain, ADK, OpenAI/Mistral/Gemini APIs, Hugging Face Transformers, RAG, spaCy, fine-tuning
MLOps & Deploy : Docker, CI/CD, Azure, Google Cloud Platform
Web : Django, FastAPI
Vision/OCR : OpenCV, Tesseract
Databases : PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j

## ✅ What I work with (selected)

ML: Logistic/Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
DL: MLPs, CNNs, LSTMs, Transformers
LLM : RAG pipelines, retrieval, NER with LLMs, tool/function calling, agentic systems

## 📚 Recent Projects
1) Assistant Chatbot (HR & Social Rights)

LLM assistant answering complex HR questions with RAG over PDFs/images.
Retrieval: FAISS/Chroma; OCR: EasyOCR; Orchestration: LangChain
Stack: Python, Django, OpenAI API, Docker
Results: faster answers, fewer inbound emails, robust multi-doc understanding.

2) Fraud Detection System

Imbalance handling with SMOTE; models: LogReg, SVM, KNN
Focus on explainability and deployability (clean features, evaluation, baselines).

3) Movie Recommender

Collaborative filtering using KNN & SVD.
Missing-rating strategies: mean, KNN, “supercharged” KNN
Delivers personalized top-N lists with straightforward metrics (RMSE/MAE).

4) Biscuit Optimization (Ops Research)

Production planning to maximize profit and minimize waste.
Genetic Algorithms + CSP for constraints (dimensions/defects)
Python implementation designed for scalability and fast iteration.
